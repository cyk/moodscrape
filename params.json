Unfortunately, as far as I can tell, there is no way to export your score data for all time, though there is a way to export a particular month's mood chart. This script will iterate thru each month of tracking, collect the scores, and export to a csv.\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\n\r\nAspects of the script rely on Chrome-specific features and therefore probably won't work in other browsers.\r\n\r\n### License and Disclaimer\r\n\r\nThis software is licensed under the MIT License.\r\n\r\nThis project is NOT affiliated with, endorsed, or sponsored by Moodscope.","google":"UA-41755243-3","note":"Don't delete this file!
